playlist ->
  create output placeholder variable
  split playlist name into array
  loop array

    create ul div
    add div to placeholder .push()

      each track split first letter
      firstLtr----> .substr(0,1); // must faster than splitting an array
            substr returns the x,y of a string (in this case string[0])
      remaining----> .substr(1);
            returns everything from string[1] to end
          these are contained within track div
      style first letter
      style remaining
      join these two
      add result to placeholder

    close the ul & by adding to placeholder

  close tracklist div
  return the placeholder into the dom, done!
